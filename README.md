# Headcount 

Headcount is a platform for non-profits and other small organizations to promote their volunteer led events. A user can sign up, view local upcming events that need volunteers, and commit to making a difference.

To get started:

* `bundle install`

* `rails s -p 4000`

Please make sure that you have this repository running in tandem with the [frontend repo](https://github.com/Cparusso/headcount-react-frontend)
